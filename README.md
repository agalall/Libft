# Libft
Recoded a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that will be used in the upcomoing projects. 

Part 1 - Libc functions
Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

Part 2 - Additional functions
You must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc, or that are part of it but in a different form.
