# Libft
Recoded a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that will be used in the upcomoing projects. You must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.
